# Alice’s Cute To-Do List
ICS3U Final Project by Alice Kim
What the Program does:
This program is a simple text-based to-do list that lets users manage their daily tasks.
Users can:
Add new tasks
View all current tasks
Mark tasks as done
Remove tasks
Quit the program
Each task shows its status as either “Not even close” or “Finally Done.” These two statements were especially added to motivate the designated user, Alice Kim. So the statement choices are solely based on her personal experiences. 
Run the file todolist.py in any Python 3 environment like Terminal, Wing, VS Code
The program will start like this:
1) Add task
2) View tasks
3) Mark task as done
4) Remove task
5) Quit
Then, the user can type the number for what they want to do and follow the prompts to manage their tasks.

Python Skills Used
The project used several Python skills from the course: classes, functions, loops, lists, if and else statements, string formatting, etc
